Penetration testing, or pentesting, is a process of assessing the security of a system, network, or application to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Here are the key steps involved in pentesting, presented in short points:

Planning:

Define scope, goals, and objectives.
Obtain necessary permissions and legal agreements.
Identify potential risks and constraints.
Reconnaissance:

Gather information about the target (IP ranges, domains, etc.).
Perform passive reconnaissance to collect publicly available data.
Enumeration:

Actively probe the target for further information.
Identify services, applications, and potential entry points.
Vulnerability Scanning:

Use automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
Identify outdated software, misconfigurations, and common issues.
Gaining Access:

Exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access (if within scope).
Attempt to bypass authentication or use weaknesses to access systems.
Maintaining Access:

Establish persistence to maintain control after initial access.
Create backdoors or other means of re-entry.
Analysis:

Review findings and assess the potential impact.
Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential damage.
Reporting:

Document findings, including detailed explanations and evidence.
Provide clear recommendations for remediation.
Remediation:

Work with the client to address and fix vulnerabilities.
Apply patches, reconfigure systems, and implement best practices.
Verification:

Verify that vulnerabilities have been properly mitigated.
Test to ensure patches and fixes are effective.
Reporting (Final):

Deliver a final report summarizing the pentest process, findings, and actions taken.
Include a clear assessment of the system's security posture.
Debriefing:

Conduct a debriefing session with the client to discuss the outcomes.
Share insights, lessons learned, and recommendations for ongoing security.
